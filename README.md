# photons
Port of Grant Schindler's concise ["Ray Tracing and Photon Mapping"](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~phlosoft/photon/) to JS for educational purposes. 

Intentionally ported almost line by line from [Processing](https://processing.org/) to JS, in order to preserve the original intention with the source. Complemented with a small gfx library to port Processings's drawing capabilitities to HTML5 Canvas.
